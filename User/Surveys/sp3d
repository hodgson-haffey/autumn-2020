The pictures taken will be presented to participants in the format of either a face to face communication scenario or a video communication scenario of varying group size. The images may be adapted to represent different group sizes. After the presentation of each image participants will rate how anxious each image makes them feel. <br><br>To be eligible, you will need to: <br><br>- be within the age range of 18-35 <br>- have access to a plain-coloured wall as the background to the image <br><br>Importantly this study will be conducted online, and we will be making these images available to future researchers. This means that if you agree to participate, these images will be publicly available indefinitely. <br><br>This study is conducted by Erin McDermott, Kate Coughlan and Anthony Haffey in the School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading. <br>All proposals for research using human participants are reviewed by an ethics committee before they can proceed.
