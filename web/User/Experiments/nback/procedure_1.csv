<u><b>It is advised that you complete the study on a laptop, desktop or tablet device for best screen presentation</b><u></u>.<br></u>
<br>
 Firstly, we are going to have a practice of a task that you will complete 'for real' later on. This task is called the <b>Letters Task</b>. <br>
<br>
This task will require you to look at letters on the screen presented one at a time. <br>
You will need to choose whether the current letter matches a letter presented some letters back.<br>
<br>
You are going to complete <u>3 practice rounds</u> of the Letters Task.<br><br>

 To prepare, please place your dominant hand on the keyboard with your index and middle fingers resting on the ""n"" and ""m"" keys.<br>
