Previous research has shown that consumption of flavonoid-rich foods may improve cognition and mood.<br>\n\n<br>\nThe study will be completed online via a weblink and will not require any changes in diet. Your participation will be done in one sitting from any location where you have access to the internet. <b>It is advised that you complete the study on a laptop, desktop or tablet device for best screen presentation.</b> The study will take approximately 30 minutes, during which time you will complete a cognitive task and a set of questionnaires asking general information about you and asking questions about your mood and diet. <br>\n<br>\n\n\nYour data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. All information will be destroyed after a period of 5 years from the completion of the project. Taking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point. \n<br><br>\nIf you score above threshold for risk of depression you will be notified via email. Upon completion of the study all participants will be provided with mood & depression support links.<br><br>\n\nThis application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns then please get in contact with the study supervisor Dr Katie Barfoot through this email katie.barfoot@reading.ac.uk \n\nThank you for your help.",
