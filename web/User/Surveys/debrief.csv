<b>Project title: The effect of flavonoid consumption on cognition and mood in young people.</b>",instruct,,,,,
info,"Thank you for taking part in this study, we are very grateful for your contribution. ",instruct,,,,,
,"This study aims to explore whether flavonoid intake is related to mood and cognition. Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds found in foods such as berry and citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, dark chocolate, tea and red wine. Previous research has found that flavonoids may have a beneficial effect on cognition and mood in children and older adults, however little research has investigated these effects in healthy young adults. In the current study, participants were asked to answer questionnaires on habitual diet and mood and were also asked to complete a cognitive task.",instruct,,,,,
